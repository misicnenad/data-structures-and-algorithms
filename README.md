# Data Structures and Algorithms

A C# implementation of the exercises found in the Udemy course ["Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms"](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/), created by  [Andrei Neagoie](https://github.com/aneagoie/).

Lessons are implemented as interchangeble classes separated into namespaces named by the course Sections they appear in. Only the lessons that included significant coding were included in this repo.

Class name formats are:
- For theory: *Lesson + lesson_number* (e.g. `Lesson65.cs`)
- For exercises: *Lesson + lesson_number + exercise_name* (e.g. `Lesson29ExerciseBigOCalculation.cs`)

To run a specific lesson example go to Program.cs file and swap the lesson class instantiation to the desired lesson class and Run the App.

Big thanks to Andrei for creating the course!
